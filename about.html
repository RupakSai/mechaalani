            <span class="abt-ab2">Meechalani and Sons - Delivering Exceptional Food Supply Across Australia Since 1958 <br> <br>

                In 1958, Mr. Abdo Meechalani, alongside his wife, Nellie, initiated a cash van distribution enterprise, catering to patrons throughout New South Wales with a variety of local and imported goods. As the company burgeoned and attracted a wider customer base, their sons, Samir and Elias, joined the business, followed by daughters, Layla and Amira. Today, all four siblings remain at the helm of the enterprise. <br> <br>
                
                By 1973, the family seized an opportunity and acquired a warehouse situated on Sydney Road, enhancing their capacity to serve the Sydney market and expand their interstate distribution network. As demand surged, they acquired adjacent premises to accommodate the burgeoning clientele. <br> <br>
                
                In response to the escalating needs of the burgeoning independent pasta market and the increasing demand for specialized pasta products, the family made a strategic decision to commission a state-of-the-art pasta manufacturing plant. <br> <br>
                
                Now, with three generations, fifteen family members actively engaged, and a workforce of over eighty dedicated employees, the family made a strategic investment in a new establishment in Parramatta, unlocking boundless potential for growth without constraints. <br> <br>
                
                This Parramatta location stands as the cornerstone of Meechalani and Sons, catering to a vast network of pasta shops and chains across Sydney and regional areas of New South Wales. Moreover, Meechalani and Sons supply a diverse array of interstate wholesalers, serving the pasta industry nationwide. <br> <br>
                
                Meechalani and Sons boast full Quality Accreditation, supported by an advanced automated order and logistics system, ensuring seamless service across food retail, commercial, and institutional sectors. <br> <br>
                
                The legacy of Meechalani and Sons persists, consistently evolving to provide outstanding products and unparalleled service to our esteemed clientele.</span>
